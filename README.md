# Dungeons and Dragons app

Web app for manipulating character sheets and fights in Dungeons and Dragons

## Getting Started

<a href="http://dungeons-and-dragons.tk" target="_blank">Live demo</a>

Have fun :smile:

These features are available:

1. Start and stop fight (with using talents).
2. Show character info (profile, current condition, skills and characteristics, talents).
3. Update character condition (experience, health, hill etc.)
4. Simple search for skills and characteristics.
5. Change localization (add `?lng=en`, `?lng=de` or `?lng=ru` to query param).
6. Add additional information as a text.
